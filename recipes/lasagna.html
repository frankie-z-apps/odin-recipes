        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is beloved worldwide for its layers of rich flavors and textures. At its core, lasagna consists of alternating layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, a savory meat or vegetable sauce, creamy cheese filling, and often a generous topping of melted cheese. The dish is then baked until bubbly and golden brown, creating a comforting and satisfying meal.</p>
        <p>The origins of lasagna can be traced back to ancient Greece, where layered dishes similar to modern-day lasagna were prepared using ingredients like pasta, meat, and cheese. However, it was the Italians who perfected and popularized lasagna as we know it today.</p>
        <p>Traditional Italian lasagna typically features a meat sauce made with ground beef or pork, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and a blend of herbs and spices. This sauce is simmered to develop deep, robust flavors before being layered with cooked lasagna noodles and creamy ricotta cheese.</p>
        <p>In addition to the classic meat version, there are countless variations of lasagna to suit different tastes and dietary preferences. Vegetarian lasagnas often feature layers of roasted vegetables, spinach, mushrooms, or eggplant, along with a flavorful tomato sauce and plenty of cheese. Some recipes even incorporate seafood, such as shrimp or crab, for a unique twist on this timeless dish.</p>
        <p>One of the defining characteristics of lasagna is its versatility. Home cooks and chefs alike often customize the dish to include their favorite ingredients or to make use of whatever ingredients they have on hand. This adaptability has contributed to lasagna's enduring popularity and its status as a comforting staple in kitchens around the world.</p>
        <p>Whether enjoyed as a cozy family dinner, a crowd-pleasing party dish, or a comforting meal on a chilly evening, lasagna holds a special place in the hearts and palates of food lovers everywhere. With its layers of pasta, sauce, and cheese melding together to create a harmonious symphony of flavors, lasagna is a dish that never fails to delight and satisfy.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>In a large skillet or frying pan, brown the ground beef over medium heat until fully cooked. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, dried thyme, salt, pepper, and water. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat and let it simmer gently for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly.</li>
                <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain the noodles and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with half of the shredded mozzarella and half of the grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well until smooth and creamy.</li>
                <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, overlapping slightly to cover the bottom of the dish.</li>
                <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, then spoon a layer of the meat sauce on top. Repeat the layers of noodles, ricotta mixture, and meat sauce until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese over the top of the lasagna.</li>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
                <li>Once the lasagna is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
                <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade classic lasagna!</li>
