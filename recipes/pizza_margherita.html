        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pizza Margherita, hailed as the queen of pizzas, embodies the essence of Italian culinary tradition with its simple yet divine combination of flavors. At first glance, it presents itself as a masterpiece of simplicity: a round, golden crust adorned with a vibrant mosaic of tomato sauce, melted mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil leaves. However, upon closer inspection, its true beauty lies in the meticulous balance of each ingredient and the artistry behind its creation.</p>
        <p>The journey begins with the dough—a labor of love crafted from high-quality flour, water, yeast, and salt. Kneaded to perfection and left to rise, it forms the foundation of the pizza, offering a delicate yet sturdy base for the toppings. Next comes the tomato sauce, made from the finest San Marzano tomatoes, prized for their sweetness and depth of flavor. Spread thinly across the dough, it infuses each bite with a bright, tangy essence that sets the stage for the culinary symphony to come.</p>
        <p>Then, the pièce de résistance: the cheese. Fresh mozzarella, with its creamy texture and mild flavor, takes center stage, melting into a luscious blanket of richness that envelops the entire pizza. Sliced or torn into bite-sized pieces, it creates pockets of gooey goodness that tantalize the taste buds with each indulgent bite. And finally, the finishing touch: fragrant basil leaves, scattered delicately over the cheese, imparting a burst of freshness and herbaceous aroma that elevates the dish to new heights.</p>
        <p>As the pizza emerges from the oven, its crust golden and crisp, its cheese bubbling and aromatic, it is a feast for the senses—a celebration of simplicity, quality, and the timeless allure of Italian cuisine. With each slice, you embark on a culinary journey through the streets of Naples, where the Pizza Margherita reigns supreme as a testament to the artistry of pizza-making and the joy of savoring life's simple pleasures. Buon appetito!</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar, and active dry yeast. Make a well in the center and pour in the lukewarm water and olive oil. Stir until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
                <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes, or until it is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky. Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
                <li>While the dough is rising, prepare the tomato sauce. In a blender or food processor, blend the canned San Marzano tomatoes until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature setting, preferably with a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to preheat as well.</li>
                <li>Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions. Roll each portion out into a round shape, about 12 inches (30cm) in diameter, on a lightly floured surface.</li>
                <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough rounds to parchment paper or a lightly floured pizza peel.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of the prepared tomato sauce evenly over each dough round, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
                <li>Arrange the sliced or torn fresh mozzarella cheese over the tomato sauce.</li>
                <li>Tear or chiffonade the fresh basil leaves and scatter them over the cheese.</li>
                <li>Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over the assembled pizzas.</li>
                <li>Carefully transfer the pizzas (on parchment paper or pizza peel) to the preheated oven, either directly onto the pizza stone or onto the preheated baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and crispy, and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Remove the pizzas from the oven and let them cool slightly before slicing and serving.</li>
                <li>Enjoy your authentic Pizza Margherita straight from the oven, with its crisp crust, gooey cheese, and fresh basil flavor. Buon appetito!</li>
